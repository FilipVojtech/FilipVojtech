- 👋 Hi, I’m @FilipVojtech, a programmer based in Czechia  
    I created some billion dollar ideas, but due to *mysterious consequences* I wasn't able to complete them.
-  My current endeavour is a web app for better management of Spotify playlists called Playlist DJ.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Svelte, TypeScript and [MikroORM](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm)
